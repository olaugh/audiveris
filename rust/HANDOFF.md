# Rust port takeover

This is the continuation record for the source-guided Audiveris Rust port. Read
`PORTING.md` first, then this file. The port is an AGPL-3.0-or-later derivative and
is intentionally parallel to the unchanged Java production tree.

## Repository state

- Repository: `/Users/john/sources/jul10-charter/omr/tools/audiveris`
- Branch: `codex/rust-port`
- Java baseline: Audiveris 5.11.0, source commit
  `9e1e55cd2746037d059345881c53e6a6754bffbd`
- Rust workspace: `rust/`
- JDK 25: `/Users/john/sources/jul10-charter/omr/tools/jdk25/Contents/Home`
- Java test baseline: 39 suites, 212 executions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 1 skip

The Java checkout has 991 production files and about 327,673 lines. Its unit suite
does not run the 20-stage recognizer, save an asserted `.omr`, or compare MusicXML.
Do not equate either Java or Rust unit-test success with recognition parity.

At the forty-ninth checkpoint the Rust workspace executes 177 tests:

- `audiveris-core`: 38
- `audiveris-image`: 78
- `audiveris-omr`: 46
- `audiveris-testkit`: 6
- `audiveris-cli`: 4
- `xtask`: 5

The live Java/Rust oracle compares 40 canonical vectors at this checkpoint. SCALE
matches on Chula plus three parent-corpus pages: K545 exercises a small-interline
population, Essen rejects a weak beam and extrapolates, and Josquin accepts a weak beam
exactly at the two-pixel distance threshold. Commit `27dbfeb6` briefly encoded the wrong
out-of-domain combo behavior; `87b6a4e3` corrects it and freezes the Java behavior in
both a focused test and the full-page vector. GRID now matches both a branch-heavy
synthetic section fixture and the real Chula page through run dispatch, long-run
purging, both lag policies, and every section's run content digest.
The next GRID boundary also matches Java for compound bounds, weight, its historical
true-length hole arithmetic, thickness, endpoint probes, five spline positions/slopes,
and range checks. Floating spline output is explicitly canonicalized at `1e-14` because
HotSpot and Rust differ by one ULP in one quadratic expression.
The factory slice now also matches Java's core/local-fatness filtering, stable
reverse-length traversal, successful/rejected real-gap merges, and every horizontal overlap gate:
sample placement, ordinate delta, combined/individual probe thickness, consistency,
internal space, slope, and expansion contact. Its full neutral lifecycle now includes
leftover selection, fixed grown-box filtering, repeated attachment, and the final merge.
A bounded digest covers real Chula page sections without turning the oracle into an
unbounded production run. Glyph/index ownership and vertical filaments remain outside.
The lossless `book.xml` view now exposes absent-versus-empty persisted step lists and
the latest completed stage while preserving all original bytes and rejecting unknown
or duplicate step tokens.
Direct sheet input path and positive image rank are also typed atomically; an absent
input remains distinct because Java then falls back to the book-level source.
The same lossless view now exposes sheet compatibility attributes and direct page
references while leaving nested page/system/SIG content opaque. GRID additionally
has the dependency-light sticker filter, comb state, and early ordered line-cluster
core; recursive comb discovery, cluster merging, trimming, SIG, and UI behavior remain
outside the ported surface.

A one-off read-only audit also opened, parsed, re-encoded, and byte-compared every member
of three real Audiveris 5.11.0 archives: Essen (115,350 uncompressed bytes), K545
(898,147), and Schumann Op. 48 No. 2 (1,547,112). Each had four members and one sheet;
tightened resource limits rejected all three. The disposable audit executable was not
retained, so this is evidence, not yet a checked-in regression.

## Verify before editing

From `rust/`:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo run -p xtask -- baseline
cargo run -p xtask -- vectors
cargo run -p xtask -- manifest
```

To rerun Java rather than inspect its current XML reports:

```sh
cargo run -p xtask -- baseline --run-java
```

Both Java-running commands resolve the sibling JDK automatically when `JAVA_HOME`
is absent. `vectors` compiles its probe against the real frozen Audiveris classes;
it does not duplicate production Java implementations in the harness.

## Design decisions to preserve

- Headless recognition comes first. Do not port Swing package structure into Rust.
- Java is the behavioral oracle until each stage passes differential fixtures.
- Rust crate boundaries follow data flow, not Java's cyclic packages.
- Use tagged enums and stable IDs for SIG `Inter`/`Relation` types; do not reproduce
  the Java inheritance graph.
- Keep exact topology and integer classifications strict. Use declared tolerances
  only for floating grades, geometry, fonts, OCR boxes, and PDF rasterization.
- Compare canonical semantic MusicXML graphs, not XML bytes or ZIP member order.
- Preserve unknown `.omr` ZIP members, XML nodes, attributes, IDs, and IDREFs in the
  initial read-only compatibility layer.
- Parity reproduces Java behavior, including Java errors. Accuracy improvement is a
  separate held-out gate and requires an explicit divergence waiver.

## Next implementation slices

Commit each slice separately after the full verification block above.

1. Continue `GRID` with source-guided staff-line comb/cluster formation around the
   now-ported pattern, tally, and filament-factory primitives; keep glyph ownership and
   UI/SIG integration out until the neutral behavior has stronger live vectors.
2. Extend `.omr` typing only through bounded read-only views that preserve every
   unknown byte and distinguish absent, malformed, and undeclared members explicitly.
3. Migrate future stage snapshots onto `audiveris-testkit` incrementally; keep the
   current vector ordering stable while its key-aware diagnostics catch schema drift.
4. Add Tesseract data to the oracle manifest when its resolved runtime location is
   known; the bundled classifier, fonts, JDK metadata, and image fixtures are frozen.
5. Freeze or vendor the three parent-corpus SCALE pages before expecting `xtask vectors`
   to work in a standalone Audiveris clone; today those vectors deliberately resolve
   `../../data/synth/...` from this parent OMR checkout.
6. Port the remaining `GRID` contracts, then subsequent stages strictly in `OmrStep`
   order. Stop comparison at
   the first differing stage so later agreement cannot hide an upstream mismatch.

## Differential fixture plan

Use canonical PNGs for algorithm parity. Treat PDF rasterization as a separate tolerant
gate. Deep cases should include `chula`, `BachInvention5`, rotated `SchbAvMaSample`,
multi-page `Dichterliebe`, `zizi`, `allegretto`, and `carmen` from `data/examples`, plus
Papillons and a held-out IMSLP set.

For each stage record stable, sorted neutral data:

- page dimensions and scale;
- binary mask hash, black count, runs, and sections;
- systems, staves, measures, and coordinate frames;
- every interpretation's shape, bounds, grade, staff/system/measure, and semantic data;
- every SIG relation and exclusion/support decision;
- classifier top-k vector and OCR output where applicable.

Final gates are semantic MusicXML equality, bidirectional `.omr` compatibility, held-out
accuracy/non-regression, and performance. The Java UI is not part of the initial
production-sidecar milestone.

## Incremental-commit rule

Never leave the branch depending on an uncommitted multi-stage rewrite. A commit message
must identify the ported behavior, and `PORTING.md` must be updated in the same commit.
If interrupted mid-slice, reset nothing: leave the last green commit intact and describe
the uncommitted failure at the top of this file before handing off.
