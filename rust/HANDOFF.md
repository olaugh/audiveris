# Rust port takeover

This is the continuation record for the source-guided Audiveris Rust port. Read
`PORTING.md` first, then this file. The port is an AGPL-3.0-or-later derivative and
is intentionally parallel to the unchanged Java production tree.

## Repository state

- Repository: `/Users/john/sources/jul10-charter/omr/tools/audiveris`
- Branch: `codex/rust-port`
- Java baseline: Audiveris 5.11.0, source commit
  `9e1e55cd2746037d059345881c53e6a6754bffbd`
- Rust workspace: `rust/`
- JDK 25: `/Users/john/sources/jul10-charter/omr/tools/jdk25/Contents/Home`
- Java test baseline: 39 suites, 212 executions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 1 skip

The Java checkout has 991 production files and about 327,673 lines. Its unit suite
does not run the 20-stage recognizer, save an asserted `.omr`, or compare MusicXML.
Do not equate either Java or Rust unit-test success with recognition parity.

## Green checkpoints

Every commit below was independently formatted, tested, clippy-clean with warnings
denied, and passed `git diff --check` before commit.

1. `d5ef29dd` — Cargo workspace, AGPL/port contract, pipeline enum, natural specs,
   rational arithmetic, population statistics, arrangements, and CLI parser.
2. `7a8cd034` — frozen JSON Java baseline and executable `xtask` JUnit verifier.
3. `ef1d67bd` — histogram, contextual grades, and brute-force injection solver.
4. `9797e9bb` — horizontal/vertical least-squares `BasicLine` geometry.
5. `fc4c9197` — oriented binary run tables, RLE conversion, union, purge, trim,
   raster conversion, and query behavior.
6. `6ad10fba` — chamfer distance transforms and Audiveris median-gray filtering.
7. `941fc15a` — inclusive global thresholding, alpha-over-white compositing, and
   polygon-mask enumeration.

At the seventh checkpoint the Rust workspace executes 47 tests:

- `audiveris-core`: 25
- `audiveris-image`: 16
- `audiveris-cli`: 4
- `xtask`: 2

## Verify before editing

From `rust/`:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo run -p xtask -- baseline
```

To rerun Java rather than inspect its current XML reports:

```sh
cargo run -p xtask -- baseline --run-java
```

The latter resolves the sibling JDK automatically when `JAVA_HOME` is absent.

## Design decisions to preserve

- Headless recognition comes first. Do not port Swing package structure into Rust.
- Java is the behavioral oracle until each stage passes differential fixtures.
- Rust crate boundaries follow data flow, not Java's cyclic packages.
- Use tagged enums and stable IDs for SIG `Inter`/`Relation` types; do not reproduce
  the Java inheritance graph.
- Keep exact topology and integer classifications strict. Use declared tolerances
  only for floating grades, geometry, fonts, OCR boxes, and PDF rasterization.
- Compare canonical semantic MusicXML graphs, not XML bytes or ZIP member order.
- Preserve unknown `.omr` ZIP members, XML nodes, attributes, IDs, and IDREFs in the
  initial read-only compatibility layer.
- Parity reproduces Java behavior, including Java errors. Accuracy improvement is a
  separate held-out gate and requires an explicit divergence waiver.

## Next implementation slices

Commit each slice separately after the full verification block above.

1. Port remaining pure image tests: masks, gray filters, watershed, chamfer matching,
   then exact raster-to-run extraction. Avoid PDF ingest until canonical PNG fixtures
   are working.
2. Implement `audiveris-testkit` and make `xtask parity` run neutral fixtures through
   both Java and Rust. Start with utilities/runs/images, then add stage snapshots.
3. Freeze hashes for the classifier model, music fonts, Tesseract data, JDK, and all
   fixture inputs in an oracle manifest.
4. Implement raster `LOAD`, `BINARY`, and `SCALE` contracts with exact mask/black-count,
   run-table, and scale-value comparisons.
5. Add a read-only `.omr` crate. The format is ZIP with `book.xml`, per-sheet
   `sheet#N.xml`, and `BINARY.png`; 225 Java files use JAXB annotations and the SIG
   has roughly 96 Inter and 67 Relation classes with ID/IDREF rehydration.
6. Port `GRID`, then subsequent stages strictly in `OmrStep` order. Stop comparison at
   the first differing stage so later agreement cannot hide an upstream mismatch.

## Differential fixture plan

Use canonical PNGs for algorithm parity. Treat PDF rasterization as a separate tolerant
gate. Deep cases should include `chula`, `BachInvention5`, rotated `SchbAvMaSample`,
multi-page `Dichterliebe`, `zizi`, `allegretto`, and `carmen` from `data/examples`, plus
Papillons and a held-out IMSLP set.

For each stage record stable, sorted neutral data:

- page dimensions and scale;
- binary mask hash, black count, runs, and sections;
- systems, staves, measures, and coordinate frames;
- every interpretation's shape, bounds, grade, staff/system/measure, and semantic data;
- every SIG relation and exclusion/support decision;
- classifier top-k vector and OCR output where applicable.

Final gates are semantic MusicXML equality, bidirectional `.omr` compatibility, held-out
accuracy/non-regression, and performance. The Java UI is not part of the initial
production-sidecar milestone.

## Incremental-commit rule

Never leave the branch depending on an uncommitted multi-stage rewrite. A commit message
must identify the ported behavior, and `PORTING.md` must be updated in the same commit.
If interrupted mid-slice, reset nothing: leave the last green commit intact and describe
the uncommitted failure at the top of this file before handing off.
