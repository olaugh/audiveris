# Porting contract and status

## Frozen source baseline

- Audiveris source: `9e1e55cd2746037d059345881c53e6a6754bffbd` (`5.11.0`)
- Java command: `JAVA_HOME=../jdk25/Contents/Home ./gradlew :app:test --no-daemon`
- Baseline on 2026-08-02: 212 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors, 1 skipped
- Production source inventory: 991 Java files, about 327,673 lines

The checked-in Java tests are necessary but not sufficient. They cover only a
small fraction of the recognizer. Every recognition stage also needs golden and
differential tests against the frozen Java executable.

## Compatibility gates

1. Rust unit tests port the observable assertions from the corresponding Java tests.
2. Neutral fixtures compare deterministic Java and Rust results, including errors.
3. `.omr` input/output remains versioned and round-trip safe. Unknown XML and ZIP
   members must be preserved until the Rust schema is complete.
4. Stage outputs are compared in pipeline order so downstream agreement cannot hide
   an upstream mismatch.
5. Whole-score MusicXML and recognition metrics are evaluated separately from unit
   test parity.

## Pipeline

`LOAD -> BINARY -> SCALE -> GRID -> HEADERS -> STEM_SEEDS -> BEAMS -> LEDGERS ->`
`HEADS -> STEMS -> REDUCTION -> CUE_BEAMS -> TEXTS -> MEASURES -> CHORDS -> CURVES ->`
`SYMBOLS -> LINKS -> RHYTHMS -> PAGE`

The first implementation slice ports dependency-light contracts used throughout the
pipeline: natural-number specifications, rational arithmetic, online populations,
arrangement generation, the pipeline-step enum, and CLI parsing.
